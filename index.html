            Giant pandas are among the rarest mammals in the world. <b> There are probably less than 1,000 left in the wild</b>. Although adult giant pandas have few natural enemies, the young are sometimes preyed upon by leopards. Habitat encroachment and destruction are the greatest threats to the continued existence of the giant panda.

            This is mainly <i>because of the demand for land and natural resources by China's 1 billion inhabitants.</i> To offset this situation, the Chinese government has set aside 11 nature preserves where bamboo flourishes and giant pandas are known to live.

            Giant pandas are being poached, <u>because their dense fur carries a high price in illegal markets in the Far East.</u> The Chinese government has imposed life sentences for those convicted of poaching giant pandas. The low reproductive capacity of the giant panda makes it more vulnerable to these threats, and less capable of rebounding from its low numbers. In 1984, due to its decreasing numbers, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the giant panda as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act. This means it is considered in danger of extinction throughout all of its range.
